		<p style="margin: 25px; text-align:center; font-size: 18px;"><em>This week will uncover the "mystery" behind the Internet. What happens when you type a URL into your browser so that a webpage magically appears? What is HTML5 &amp; what happened to HTML 1 - 4?</em></p>
		<p style="margin:25px; font-size: 18px;">HTML stands for <em>"HyperText Markup Language."</em> It is way of marking up files so that browsers such as Internet Explorer, Safari, Google Chrome, Firefox et cetera know how to display your content as a webpage. HTML uses tags to distinguish between content (what the user should see) &amp; the instructions to displaying them. A webpage isn't just one file but many pieces put together by your browser using something called the request response cycle.</p>

		<h3 style="margin: 25px; font-size: 20px">The Evolution of HTML</h3>
		<p style="margin: 25px; font-size: 18px">At the beginning &ndash; you start with what is the full form of HTML and how the markup languages are different from that of the programming languages. Then, the early years of HTML will be discussed. HTML1 was created in 1990 as a way to electronically connect documents via hyperlinks. <em>The idea of the web originated here.</em> We will find out what <i>www</i> is &ndash; world wide web. The challenges between mosaic, netscape and internet explorer. We'll know about what all happened in something called as the <em>Browser Wars.</em></p>
		<p style="margin: 25px; font-size: 18px;">Here are few links attached for knowing more about the browser wars:</p>

		<p style="margin: 25px; font-size: 18px"><em>No one "runs" the internet.</em> &mdash; However, there are some groups which do take a proactive role in setting up these standards:</p>

		<h3 style="margin: 25px; font-size: 20px">The difference between Syntax &amp; Symantics.</h3>
		<p style="margin: 25px; font-size: 18px">Let's see the difference between the syntax &amp; Symantics &mdash; Syntax is the arrangement of elements and attributes to create well-formed documents. Now, coming to Symantics &mdash; Semantics is concerned with meaning. In HTML, this is the purpose of elements and attributes, and the logical (sense and reference) relationship between elements and the attributes of those elements. </p>

		<h3 style="margin: 25px; font-size: 20px">The Request/Response Cycle: What happens when you type into a URL.</h3>
		<p style="margin: 25px; font-size: 18px"><em>The web is a cycle of requests and responses that flow between clients and servers.</em></p>
		<p style="margin: 25px; font-size: 18px">This is one of the most fascinating concept while you start to learn how the internet works. To know &amp; understand this cycle, you have to know what a client &amp; the server is. You also have to know what a HTTP Request is. HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. There's also a thing called HTTPS. Now, what's that? It's a fascinating concept.</p>
