		<h1 style="text-align:center; background-color:lightgrey;">INTRODUCTION TO HTML5</h1>
		<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;">Hi! My name is Aneesh, and I'm a sophomore in Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra.</p>
		<p style="margin:25px; font-size: 18px;">This is a sample webpage built entirely based on the knowledge of HTML5 acquired in the course of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;"><b>"Introduction to HTML5" by Colleen van Lent sponsored by University of Michigan.</b></a> I'm really excited to share my thoughts about the things I learnt in this course.
		<br><br> So, without any further ado &mdash; Lets get going!<br><br>Here's a navigation bar for you to navigate through the important sections in this webpage:</p>

		<h3 style="margin:25px; font-size:20px">Introduction</h3>
		<p style="margin:25px; font-size:18px">In this course, you are going to learn about the absolute basics of HTML5 or if we elaborate it: HyperText Markup Language and this is going to be your introduction to not only HTML but, also to the World of Web Design. The instructor has designed this course very well, it is basically divided into three segments or three weeks of study I should say.</p>
		<ol style="margin:25px">
			<li style="font-size:18px"><a href="week1.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;"><b>Week 1: How the internet works!</b></a>
				<ul>
					<li>In the week one of the course, you learn about the evolution of HTML, about how we went from HTML1 to HTML5 over the course of the years. The browsers, and about the browser wars. We will also see the difference between Syntax &amp; Semantics in HTML5. Then, you learn about what happens when you enter an address into the url. Something called as &mdash; The Request/Response Cycle. It's interesting to learn about what happens behind when you want access a webpage.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li style="font-size:18px">
				<a href="week2.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;"><b>Week 2: Let's learn how to <code style="color:grey">code</code> in HTML5!</b></a>
				<ul>
					<li>This is where we learn how to code. It's the most important segment of the course. It's where you get your hands dirty. You'll be introduced to enormous number of HTML tags. You'll be learning about how to add headings, paragaphs, lists, links, tables, multimedia such as images, videos and it's controls onto your web page.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li style="font-size:18px"><a href="week3.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;"><b>Week 3: Accessibility; Validating your code & hosting it on the Internet!</b></a>
				<ul>
					<li>By this time, we'll be atleast knowing how to create a basic HTML file which is syntactically &amp; symantically correct. Now what? We'll learn about why accessability &amp; validating your code is very important. Then, we'll move on to the most exciting part &mdash; Hosting your page on the web. Using the free/paid hosting services and domain names, we can launch your first HTML page on the internet for the world to witness!</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
