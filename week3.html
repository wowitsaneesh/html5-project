		<h3 style="margin: 25px; font-size: 20px">Hosting your site</h3>
		<p style="margin: 25px; font-size: 18px">The basic requirements we need for hosting a website are a domain name &amp; a hosting service (paid or free). The domain names are purchased for multiple years at a cheap rate. Most common is .com, but other extensions are gaining acceptance. <em>Domain names are useless on their own.</em> Hosting Serves vary from free services to mid-range services to full services. You need a registered IP address to connect with your domain name. You can sign up for <a href="https://byet.host/" style="text-decoration: none;">Byethost</a>. It is very important in life to remember your passwords. <em><b>Remember your passowords.</b></em></p>
